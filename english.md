## üìã What is a Code of Conduct?
What is a Code of Conduct? It is a set of rules to guide a group of people's conduct and activities per its principles and objectives. The community must consider and take this code of conduct seriously, whether people participate or organize it. This document may be constantly updated to meet community needs. Everyone is responsible for following up on changes to this code of conduct.
Don't hesitate to contact the community organization if there are any suggestions or constructive criticism about the rules. We emphasize that the community will consider this code in all its groups, in all social media, and in any and all events or projects.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Good practices:

- Be kind. All people start full of doubts, so let's help and guide those who are at the beginning or at any other time of study or career, regardless of experience level or time;
- Give constructive criticism if necessary. But never use words to offend someone. The goal is to grow and help each other and not the other way around;
- Be curious and look for answers, for example, in our documents. There are many ways to learn, just as there are many ways to share knowledge;
- Avoid discussions like "technology X is better than technology Y". Each technology has its purpose and utility. Have common sense in your placements and respect other people's opinions and experiences;

- Responsibly encourage forms of expression;
- Study and evolve our learning about Open Source, Python, RPA, and related subjects.

### ‚ùå We condemn:
- Stalking, doxxing (investigating a person's life without authorization), or releases of private information;
- Threats and harassment of any kind;
- Any behavior that compromises people's physical and psychological safety and participation.
- These attitudes ARE NOT CORRECT. If you do not agree with these rules, please unsubscribe from this community.

You can also talk to us sending an e-mail to [community@botcity.dev](mailto:community@botcity.dev);
- Any unsatisfactory or dubious point in the current code of conduct must be taken and dealt with by the organization.
